## Memcached API clients

The reset button has been hit on the clients page. If you have a client you want to
list, either you wrote or enjoy, please submit a pull request or patch to the
wiki.

The old list was largely out of date. Many clients have come and gone. If you
want to find out what to use you should search for information regarding the
language you are using.

Most languages have module indexes (like CPAN, NPM, Gem, etc). With those and
googling of tutorials and articles you can learn about the different clients
available to you and pick one which best suits your needs.

### Overview

Number of important bugfixes for seccomp and extstore. Extstore platform
portability has been greatly improved for ARM and 32bit systems.

### Fixes

  * fix sasl tests
  * fix flaky extstore tests
  * alignment and 32bit fixes for extstore
  * crc32c for aarch64 support
  * fix rare partial deadlock during hash table expansion
  * Add Dockerfile definitions
  * Fix lru-crawler behaviour for seccomp
  * Fail loudly if seccomp setup fails

### New Features

Thanks to @aparida1 from Qualcomm, extstore now has hardware CRC32 support for
ARMv8 when available.

Enabling it requires a few extra steps:
`./configure CFLAGS="-march=armv8-a+crc" --enable-extstore --enable-arm-crc`

this should autodetect better in future releases.

Thanks to the help of @tianon and a few bug reports, extstore now works on
32bit systems and a number of ARM platforms.

### Overview

Bugfixes and small changes. Thanks to the many external contributors in this
release!

The strncpy bug was found by a security group:

 *  Jonas Jensen
 *  Geoffrey White
 *  Antonio Morales

... though given the nature of the bug, while it will trip ASAN, there's no
way to exploit it and it only occurs over unix domain sockets. No data is
copied past the end of any buffers. Still, we take this seriously and have
repaired the offending code, just in case.

### Fixes

  * fix strncpy call in `stats conns` to avoid ASAN violation
  * extstore: fix indentation
  * add error handling when calling dup function
  * add unlock when item_cachedump malloc failed
  * extstore: emulate pread(v) for macOS
  * fix off-by-one in logger to allow CAS commands to be logged.
  * use strdup for explicitly configured slab sizes
  * move mem_requested from slabs.c to items.c (internal cleanup)

### New Features

  * add server address to the "stats conns" output
  * log client connection id with fetchers and mutations
  * Add a handler for seccomp crashes

### Overview

Bugfix release.

Important note: if using `--enable-seccomp`, privilege dropping is no longer
on by default. The feature is experimental and many users are reporting
hard to diagnose problems on varied platforms.

Seccomp is now marked EXPERIMENTAL, and must be explicitly enabled by adding
`-o drop_privileges`. Once we're more confident with the usability of the
feature, it will be enabled in `-o modern`, like any other new change. You
should only use it if you are willing to carefully test it, especially if
you're a vendor or distribution.

Also important is a crash fix in extstore when using the ASCII protocol, large
items, and running low on memory.

Thanks to the many people who've participated in this release :) Lots of
commits from the community this time around!
